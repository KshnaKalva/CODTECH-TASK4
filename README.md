# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- TO-DO LIST APPLICATION WITH LOCAL STORGE

### Overview of the To-Do List Code

This HTML code sets up a basic structure for a To-Do List application, which allows users to add tasks with an optional due date. The application is designed to be styled with an external CSS file and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity.

#### Key Components:

1. **HTML Document Structure:**
   - **DOCTYPE Declaration:** Specifies the HTML5 document type.
   - **`<html lang="en">`:** Root element of the document with language set to English.
   - **`<head>`:**
     - **Meta Tags:** Includes charset for character encoding and viewport settings for responsive design.
     - **Title:** Enclosed in a `<marquee>` tag to scroll the title "To-Do List".
     - **Link to External CSS:** Links to an external stylesheet (`style.css`) for styling the application.
   - **`<body>`:**
     - Contains the main content of the To-Do List application.

2. **Container (`<div class="container">`):**
   - Main wrapper that holds the entire application content.
   
3. **To-Do Application (`<div class="todo-app">`):**
   - **Title Section (`<div class="title">`):**
     - Displays the application title "To-Do List".
     - Includes an image logo.
   - **Input Row (`<div class="row">`):**
     - **Text Input:** An input field for adding new tasks (`id="input-box"`).
     - **Date Input (`<span class="date-box">`):** An optional date picker for setting a due date (`id="exprieDate"`).
     - **Add Buttons:** Two buttons to add tasks, each with a different class for styling purposes (`class="btn1"` and `class="btn2"`), both calling the `addTask()` function when clicked.
   - **Task List (`<ul id="list-container" class="scroll">`):**
     - A container where the list of tasks will be dynamically displayed.

4. **JavaScript:**
   - Linked through an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) which will contain the logic for adding, displaying, and managing tasks.

### Key Elements:

- **Input Fields:** Allow users to enter the task text and optionally select a due date.
- **Add Buttons:** Buttons to trigger the addition of tasks to the list.
- **Task List Container:** An unordered list that will be populated with tasks dynamically using JavaScript.

### <ins>Summary</ins>:

This To-Do List application is a foundational project that demonstrates the integration of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The use of input fields and buttons allows users to add tasks, and the JavaScript will handle task management, making the application interactive and user-friendly. This setup provides a comprehensive base that can be further enhanced with additional features such as task editing, sorting, and persistent storage.
